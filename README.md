# Focus-Depth-Selector-

This is a program to construct the sharpest possible image from the raw data from a class of digital microscopes that take scans as shown on the image below. The selected focus upon scanning is set based on the center of the images taken, but if the sample being scanned is not perfectly flat some of the objects will be out of focus. This program selects the sharpest parts of the images and constructs an image that has the highest VOL (Variance of Laplacian).
